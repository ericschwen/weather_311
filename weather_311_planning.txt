Weather-311 project planning
Author: Eric Schwen
Date: 6/2/23

Weather data: 
	Mean temperature, max temp, and min temp are certainly strongly colinear. Maybe just look at
	mean temp (or otherwise account for colinearity)
	
	Dew Point is closely related to humidity, which accounts for how hot it feels. Maybe engineer
	a more relevant variable than just dew point.
	
	Restrict to just NYC for analysis. Can just use latitude and longitude max and min from NYC data
	to slice to only that region.
	
	NYC pretty much all the same temperature/weather? Check this. Could take average for all of NYC
	for single day (at least initially).

	Implementation plan: Make an array (or column in new df) of all dates of interest. For loop through and select
	all weather stations in NYC at current date. Probably average results (at least for initial pass where I'm not
	taking spatial variation into account).
	
311 call data:
	Mostly just interested in volume (number) of calls each day. Group and sum number of calls per day.
	Implementation plan: Make an array (or column in new df) of all dates of interest. For loop through and select
	all calls between current and next date in array.
	
	Could go back to investigate how reports to different departments vary with weather (ex: more sanitation
	complaints during hot summer than during winter or something).
	
	Complaints likely vary with day of week (more or fewer on weekends for example). Could have day of
	week as an input to model.
	
Modeling plan:
	Initially average all weather data per day across only NYC. (Could do by borough or something later)
	Sum all calls per day across NYC.
	Join these two tables/dataframes. Check that dates match.
	
	Features: Mean temperature, dew point (or derived humidity variable), 
		rainfall, snowfall, day of week?, etc.
	Output: Number of 311 calls (in day)
